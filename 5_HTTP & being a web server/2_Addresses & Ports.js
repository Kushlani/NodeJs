/*
Port :- 
	Ports are always attached to the TCP/UDP transport layer.
	Port numbers are from 0 to 65535(This means we can run 65535 application at the same time).
	Ports 0 to 1024 are reserved for use by certain privileged services.
	Every server has a specific port number
	When we send data via TCP/IP we add port number after the IP address( ex: 78.132.160.4:433)433 is the port number

Address :-
	We call this(78.132.160.4:433) a Socket address
