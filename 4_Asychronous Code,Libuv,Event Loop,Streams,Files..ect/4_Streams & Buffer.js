/*
Buffer :
	A temporary holding spot for data being moved from one place to another.

Stream :
	A sequence of data made available over time. Pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole. 
	ex: a film streaming on the internet.. it means always the data will flow as a stream. then at some point the data will gather
	from the buffer and pass it to process.
